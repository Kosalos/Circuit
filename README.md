Mac app for laying out single sided PCB boards

You're welcome to try it if you understand there are expected warts, bugs and design flaws.
But for the most part it works great.
I use Acorn (a Mac 2D drawing program) to grab a screenshot of the small sized PCB view for printing on the laser printer.

Press the '?' key to lauch the help dialog to get started.

Step 1: find a schematic you want to build. I attached Acorn and PNG files of two projects I build successfully.
Visit Muffwiggler.com, and search for author Kosalos to find all the projects I posted there. 
They were all designed with this program.
